# âš½ Seq2Seq-Event-Forecasting-of-Soccer-Ball-Actions
This project benchmarks sequence-to-sequence models for football (soccer) event forecasting using pseudo ground truth from the SoccerNet Ball Action Spotting 2025 challenge.

## ðŸ”‘ Task  
Given a sequence of 5 past ball actions, predict the next action.

12 unique actions

12,428 total events 

## ðŸ¤– Models  
- Random Baseline (uniform / weighted)  
- LSTM Seq2Seq  
- Transformer Seq2Seq  

## ðŸ“Š Evaluation
